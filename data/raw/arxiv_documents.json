However, aligning\nthe link between GitHub repositories and academic papers can prove difficult,\nand the current practice of establishing and maintaining such links remains\nunknown. This paper investigates the role of academic paper references\ncontained in these repositories. We conduct a large-scale study of 20 thousand\nGitHub repositories that make references to academic papers. We use a\nmixed-methods approach to identify public access, traceability and evolutionary\naspects of the links. Although referencing a paper is not typical, we find that\na vast majority of referenced academic papers are public access. These\nrepositories tend to be affiliated with academic communities. More than half of\nthe papers do not link back to any repository. We find that academic papers\nfrom top-tier SE venues are not likely to reference a repository, but when they\ndo, they usually link to a GitHub software repository. In a network of arXiv\npapers and referenced repositories, we find that the most referenced papers are\n(i) highly-cited in academia and (ii) are referenced by repositories written in\ndifferent programming languages.\n", "authors": ["Supatsara Wattanakriengkrai", "Bodin Chinthanet", "Hideaki Hata", "Raula Gaikovina Kula", "Christoph Treude", "Jin Guo", "Kenichi Matsumoto"], "published": "2020-04-01T02:14:15Z"}, {"title": "The Milnor $\\bar\u03bc$ invariants and nanophrases", "summary": "  Two link diagrams are link homotopic if one can be transformed into the other\nby a sequence of Reidemeister moves and self crossing changes.

In this paper, we focus on semi-regular links, a class of\nbiperiodic alternating links whose hyperbolic structure can be immediately\ndetermined from a corresponding Euclidean tiling. Consequently, we determine\nthe exact volumes of semi-regular links. We relate their commensurability and\narithmeticity to the corresponding tiling, and assuming a conjecture of Milnor,\nwe show there exist infinitely many pairwise incommensurable semi-regular links\nwith the same invariant trace field. We show that only two semi-regular links\nhave totally geodesic checkerboard surfaces; these two links satisfy the Volume\nDensity Conjecture. Finally, we give conditions implying that many additional\nbiperiodic alternating links are hyperbolic and admit a positively oriented,\nunimodular geometric triangulation. We also provide sharp upper and lower\nvolume bounds for these links.\n", "authors": ["Abhijit Champanerkar", "Ilya Kofman", "Jessica S. Purcell"], "published": "2018-02-14T22:31:49Z"}]
